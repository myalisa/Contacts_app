Some challenges I've had to overcome:
Exchange Year
Chinese

I faced these challenges by reminding myself that they are temporary and if I stay relaxed and focused I will make it out in one piece.

I appreciate my ability to adapt to new environments very quickly, and my social skills. I don't appreciate my tendency to abandon projects or things that I'd like to accomplish, I also don't appreciate my tendency to become very invested in things and feel defeated when I do not get the desired result.

Times in my life where I've felt uncomfortable or frustrated:

Most recently, while in Nicaragua, I often felt anxious and uncomfortable in my environment. My host family did not have electricity most of the time, and tnis made simple daily tasks like getting ready or finding my belongings, showering etc. very difficult. I felt frustrated becuase my friend who I was travelling with was more prepared than I was for those conditions. My body tensed up and I felt nervous all the time and sad becuase I didn't feel that I was able to overcome these challenges for the month that I was there. 

I also felt frustrated in the final months of my last job. After graduating college I was excited to start working at such a well known company and had the expectation that I would be working there for many years. However, when the company was restructured and my role changed, I felt dissappointed and angry towards the company and leadership. This was a time where I had a fixed mindset and wasn't able to adapt, and instead of trying to adapt, I recognized that the job was no longer serving any benefit to me, and I left.

In order to cope with these feelings of frustration or anxiousness, I like to think about my long term goals, and try and see my situation from a different perspective.
