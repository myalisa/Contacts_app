After graduating from IU Media School with a minor in Mandarin, I started working as a Travel Sales Coordinator for National Geographic. My role at Nat Geo expanded upon my interest in travel and travel planning which lead to a cultivation of interests in different fields such as travel tech and software engineering. I started Actualize bootcamp with the intention to work remotely and travel year-round, but after delving deeper into the career possibilities in this field, I am now primarily looking for a company who values companionship and culture. My ideal role utilizes the skills I have cultivated and provides an avenue for growth.
